    "A common task when working with gridded data is clipping that grid to the region that you are interested in.

The DEM we will use was downloaded from [koordinates](https://koordinates.com/layer/1418-nz-80m-digital-elevation-model/) and is distributed under a creative commons license (which is also in the data folder). Other DEMs are available - [LINZ has an 8m resolution DEM](https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/51768-nz-8m-digital-elevation-model-2012/), but it is 17GB...\n",
