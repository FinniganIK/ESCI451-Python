# Helpers

This is a basic python module containing some helpful code for the ESCI451 notebooks.
This code was not included directly in the notebooks to reduce the "boiler-plate" code
that the students were exposed to, and provide the students with some code to take
away with them.

If you are a student, don't be afraid, please do look at this code!
